# KicadlibBrowser3D
Online kicad lib browser for footprints and 3D models.

This is an unfinished work but it can be tested here : https://xcs400.github.io/KicadlibBrowser3D/

The models and footprint are rendered using threejs/webgl. 

todo: 
 -fix bugs (mainly in the .kicad_mod parser)
 -generate a dynamic list from the official .pretty folder (here it is static from modellist.js)
 -add external public path
 -setup a better browser
